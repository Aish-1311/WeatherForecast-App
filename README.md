Weather Forecasting ApplicationðŸŒ¤ðŸŒ¥

WeatherForecast is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the Open Weather Map API to display current weather information, including real feel, wind, humidity, and pressure, with corresponding icons for visualization. By default, the application shows weather information for Delhi, but users can search for the weather information of any place by entering its name in the search bar and pressing Enter. If the place is found, the corresponding weather details are displayed. However, if the place is not found, the application will continue to display the weather details of the previous location.
